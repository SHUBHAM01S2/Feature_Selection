# 📊 Feature Engineering: Feature Selection Guide

Feature selection is one of the most critical steps in the machine learning pipeline. It helps improve model accuracy, reduce overfitting, and shorten training time by eliminating irrelevant or redundant features.

This guide outlines the **steps and sub-steps** involved in the Feature Selection process.

---

## ✅ 1. Understand the Dataset

### 1.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze data distribution
- Identify missing values
- Detect outliers
- Visualize feature correlations

---

## 🔍 2. Identify and Drop Irrelevant Features

### 2.1 Manual Removal
- Drop columns like IDs, Names, Timestamps, etc., that do not add predictive power.

### 2.2 Domain Knowledge
- Use business understanding to remove or retain features based on relevance.

---

## 📉 3. Remove Constant and Quasi-Constant Features

### 3.1 Constant Features
- Remove features with the same value in all rows.

### 3.2 Quasi-Constant Features
- Drop features with low variance (e.g., 99% same values)
- Use `VarianceThreshold` from `sklearn`

---

## 🧹 4. Remove Duplicate Features

- Identify and drop features that are exact duplicates of others.

---

## 📊 5. Correlation-Based Feature Selection

### 5.1 Pearson Correlation (for numerical features)
- Drop one of the highly correlated features (correlation > 0.8 or < -0.8)

### 5.2 Heatmap Visualization
- Use seaborn or matplotlib to visualize correlation matrix.

---

## 🎯 6. Univariate Feature Selection

### 6.1 SelectKBest / SelectPercentile
- Use statistical tests (chi-square, ANOVA) to select top-k features.

### 6.2 Feature Importance (for Tree-Based Models)
- Use `RandomForest`, `XGBoost`, or `LightGBM` to extract feature importances.

---

## 📈 7. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

- Recursively remove features and train the model.
- Use cross-validation to find optimal number of features.

---

## 🧠 8. Embedded Methods

### 8.1 Lasso (L1 Regularization)
- Removes less important features by reducing their coefficients to zero.

### 8.2 Ridge (L2 Regularization)
- Keeps all features but penalizes large coefficients.

---

## 📎 9. Wrapper Methods

### 9.1 Forward Selection
- Start with no features and add one at a time.

### 9.2 Backward Elimination
- Start with all features and remove one at a time.

---

## 🛠️ 10. Dimensionality Reduction (Optional but Related)

### 10.1 PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Reduces feature space while preserving variance.
